  notes: `
    My goal is to give functional programming a very precise definition.

    * First-class functions: that's a requirement, and it's part of it, but it's not what is about.
      We're trying to get to a more precise definition.
    * Immutability: NOPE, typically we end up with a lot of immutability, but that's more of
      a nice side benefit, not a requirement
    * Type safety: It's great, and helps prevent bugs, and mixes really nicely with FP,
      but not what FP is about
    * Category Theory: Semigroups, Monoids, Functors, Applicatives, etc. They are useful
      for providing a terminology for what we already do. Not really the heart of FP.
    * Beautiful code: We are engineers, not sculptors. We are here to solve
    problems, not to express our hopes and desires through code.
